# 📊 Analysis on ML Test Scores

## 📌 Project Overview    
This project contains an analysis of Machine Learning test scores for students across three different batches.     
The objective is to analyze batch-wise performance and derive meaningful insights using Python.   

---

## 📁 Dataset Description    
The dataset includes the following columns:    

- **Batch** – Name of the batch       
- **User_ID** – Unique student identifier        
- **Score** – Score obtained by the student out of 7 (stored as text)      

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used    
- Python        
- Pandas      
- Jupyter Notebook       

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning Steps      
- Removed extra spaces from column names       
- Converted score values from string format (e.g., "5 / 7") to numeric format        

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed     
- Batch-wise student count    
- Mean score    
- Median score      
- Minimum and maximum scores       
- Standard deviation          

---

## 🔍 Key Insights      
- **AI_ELITE_7** is the best-performing batch with higher average and consistent scores.     
- **AI_ELITE_6** shows moderate performance with high variability.     
- **AI_ELITE_4** has the lowest average score and requires academic improvement.      

---

## 📌 Conclusion     
The analysis highlights clear performance differences between batches and helps identify areas where academic support is required.
